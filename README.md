# injection-tester
Injection Tester is a Go-based tool designed to automate the testing of various injection vulnerabilities on endpoints. It iterates over a list of injection payloads (including SQL Injection, XSS, SSTI, LDAP, Command Injection, and more) and applies different advanced encoding techniques to bypass WAF rules.
